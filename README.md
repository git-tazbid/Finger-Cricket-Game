# Finger-Cricket-Game
Do you remember those days when we used to play cricket with our fingers? Those were some of the best times, filled with happy memories. This is a 1v1 offline finger cricket game that I made using Python. You can play it with your friends and recall those sweet memories of childhood. Enjoy!
